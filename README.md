# RTL implementation of an AES Core (VHDL) — Serial & Pipelined
- Two RTL implementations of AES-128/192/256 cores.

- Serial (iterative) : unitAESEncrypt.vhd, unitAESDecrypt.vhd : One reusable round datapath; minimal area; multi-cycle latency for resource constrainted applications.
- Piplined (round piplined) : unitAESEncrypt_piplined.vhd, unitAESDecrypt_piplined.vhd : One stage per round for max throughput, keys pipelined in lockstep.
- All blocks parameterize and the top module is as follows:

## Architecture 
### Top Module 
``` bash 
entity AES is 
    generic (
        KEY_SIZE  : integer := 128; -- can be 128/192/256
        TEXT_SIZE : integer := 128; -- Always 128
        ROUNDS    : integer := 10 -- # of rounds depends on key size for 128 -> 10, 192 -> 12, 256 -> 14
    );
    port (
        i_clk        : in std_ulogic;
        i_nrst_async : in std_ulogic;
        i_mode       : in std_ulogic; -- '0' for encryption and '1' decryption 
        i_data_in    : in std_ulogic_vector(TEXT_SIZE-1 downto 0);
        i_cipher_key : in std_ulogic_vector(KEY_SIZE-1 downto 0);
        o_data_out   : out std_ulogic_vector(TEXT_SIZE-1 downto 0)
    );
end entity AES;
```
- Selects Encryption or Decryption by i_mode and wires to the cores. 
- ```i_mode='0' ``` → encryption path active
- ```i_mode='1' ``` → decryption path active

### Serial (iterative)
- Ports for Encrypt 
```bash 
port (
        i_clk : in std_ulogic;
        i_nrst_async : in std_ulogic;
        i_en_start : in std_ulogic;
        i_data_in  : in std_ulogic_vector(TEXT_SIZE-1 downto 0);
        i_cipher_key : in std_ulogic_vector(KEY_SIZE-1 downto 0);
        o_data_out : out std_ulogic_vector(TEXT_SIZE-1 downto 0)
    );
```
- On i_en_start='1', the core syncs inputs (data_sync, key_sync) and drops a local sync flag. 
- The data now loops the four stages serially SubBytes -> ShiftRows -> MixColumns -> AddRoundKey.
- A counter is used to track the changes and the output is pulled to the state once the counter reaches ROUNDS*4.
- For the final round it bypasses MixColumns.
- Output is assigned after the last step; an extra cycle is used to register it at the output of the top module.

### Round Piplined 
- The ports reamin the same for both serial and piplined implementations. 
- Each stage registers its state and the key for that stage in the same cycle, keeping them aligned.
- Final round bypasses MixColumns.

## Latency & Throughput 
- Clock Period : 10 ns;
```bash 
    # Serial 
    Latency(cycles) ≈ 4*ROUNDS + 2 -- once cycle to sync data and the other to latch
    Latency(time)   ≈ (4*ROUNDS + 2) * 10 ns
    AES-128 (10r):  ≈ 42 cycles  → ~420 ns
    AES-192 (12r):  ≈ 50 cycles  → ~500 ns
    AES-256 (14r):  ≈ 58 cycles  → ~580–590 ns
    Throughput = 1 block / (4*ROUNDS + 2) * 10 ns
    # Piplined 
    Latency ≈ (ROUNDS + 2) * 10 ns
    Throughput = 1 block / cycle after the pipe fills i.e. with an intial delay of (ROUNDS+2)*10 ns 
```

The implementation is sequential, reusing the same hardware logic across rounds, but the resouce utilization is slightly high compared to standalone implementations due to the use of an if-else statement rather than a case statement which make the design more sequential and reduces the parallelism causing a slight increase in resouce utilization.
